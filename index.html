    <h3>Bootcamp 2020: BOUNCING BALL</h3>
    <p>
A game of a sweet pink bouncing ball.
Your task is simple- collect all of the coloured dots appearing on the screen while fighting a desperate and unfair battle against the physics. But watch out. <p>
Dont step off to the spikes that appeared at the bottom or they will kill you. You don't want that.
To help yourself navigate the game using A, S, D and move one of the platforms with your mouse.
The odds are against you and the physics are a bit wonky so...<p>
GOOD LUCK!<p>
And remember- just like in real life you work hard to defy death and score some points with every bounce but for what?
What is the meaning of life?<p>
Is 42 good enough for this little ball?<p><p><p>
